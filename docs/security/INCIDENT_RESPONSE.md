   - If database breach: rotate ALL secrets (JWT, encryption keys, DB passwords)
   - Take system snapshot for forensics (do NOT wipe)

2. **Assess** (15-60 min)
   - Determine scope: which tenants, which data types (PHI, PII, financial)
   - Check audit_logs table for unauthorized access patterns
   - Review login_attempts for brute-force indicators
   - Verify backup integrity

3. **Notify** (1-4 hours)
   - Internal: CTO, legal, compliance
   - External (if PHI exposed): affected tenants within 72 hours (PDPL requirement)
   - External (if required): NTRA, data protection authority

4. **Remediate** (4-48 hours)
   - Deploy hotfix
   - Rotate all secrets
   - Force password reset for affected users
   - Enable enhanced monitoring

5. **Post-Incident** (1-7 days)
   - Write incident report
   - Identify root cause
   - Implement preventive measures
   - Update this document

### P2 — High (Confirmed Exploit)

1. Block the attack vector
2. Revoke compromised tokens/sessions
3. Deploy fix within 4 hours
4. Audit affected data
5. Document and review

### P3 — Medium (Suspicious Activity)
